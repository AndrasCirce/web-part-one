		<h1>Promise me</h1><a name="M1"></a>
	
		<p>I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
		   In case I'm not here tomorrow
 		   I'm behind on what's really important
   		   I'm hoping that I can borrow a piece of mind
		   My mind is really distorted
		   I find nothing but trouble in my life
		   I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
		   This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
		   And last night was just another distraction
		   Or a reaction of what we consider madness
		   I know exactly what happened
		   You ran outside when you heard my brother…
		   Promise that you will sing about me
		   Promise that you will sing about me
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="singAbout">
		<h1>Sing About Me</h1><a name="M2"></a>
		
		<p>Matter of fact he my favorite cause he tip me with e's
		   He got a cousin named david and I seen him last week
		   This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
		   These foster homes, I run away and never do miss em
		   See, my hormones just run away and if I can get em back
		   To where they used to be then I'll probably be in the denim
		   Of a family gene that show women how to be woman, or better yet a leader
  		   You need her to learn something, then you probably need to beat her
		   That's how I was taught
		   Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
		   And I'm exhausted
		   But fuck that "sorry for your loss" shit
		   My sister died in vain, but what point are you trying to gain
  		   If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
		   I'll wait
		</p>

	<div class= "thirst">
		<h1>Dying of Thirst</h1><a name="M3"></a>
		<p>Too many sins
		   I'm running out
		   Somebody send
		   Me a well for the drought
		   See, all I know, is taking notes
   		   On taking this life for granted
		   Granted, if he provoke
		   My best days, I stress days (lord forgive me for all my sins for I not know...)
		   My best days, I stress days
		   Say "fuck the world," my sex slave
		   Money, pussy and greed; what's my next crave
		   Whatever it is, know it's my next grave
		   Tired of running, tired of running
		   Tired of tumbling, tired of running
		   Tired of tumbling
		   Back once my momma say
		   See a pastor, give me a promise
		   What if today was the rapture, and you completely tarnished
		   The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
		   You dying of thirst
		   <span>You dying of thirst</span>
   		   So hop in that water, and pray that it works
		</p>
